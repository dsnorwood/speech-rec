    "Currently, I can't record from within my VM, and I'm not sure why. So, I run this script on my Windows host side and then move the files into my VM afterward. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use this example to record \"sounds/noises\" from the left side of my laptop and again from the right side of my laptop, hence the filenames \"left-side\" and \"right-side.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "I sample at 10kHz for one minute. My thought is to break this one minute clip into a rows of data. I'll do that in another script. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my testing, \"left-side\" is me tapping on the left side of my laptop at about a 2Hz rate. Same follows for \"right-side.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "I then use these files within the __feature-extraction__ notebook for further processing. \n",

    "My hope is that \"something\" can differentiate between each side.\n",

    "_I didn't want to use an existing example, instead I wanted to think of something I could sample on my own and build a neural network. This is all I could think of for the time being._ "
